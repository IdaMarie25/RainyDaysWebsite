            </div>
        </div>  
        <p class="exibitionspecific-introduction">For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins. Where do we come from and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.</p>
        <div class="exibitionspecific-text">
            <h2>Unraveling the mysteries of our origins</h2>
            <p>Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have evolved our time. You can also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.</p>
            <p>As we explore the journey of life on Earth, we’ll uncover the intricate processes that led to the survival and extinction of countless species. The evolution of life is not a simple path, but a complex web of adaptations, environmental changes, and natural events. The Woolly Mammoth, the Dodo, and the dinosaurs each had their own unique story, shaped by their environments and the challenges they faced. By understanding their rise and fall, we gain a deeper appreciation for the delicate balance of life that continues to evolve today</p>

                    <p>The human skull is made up of 22 bones, and when you're born, your skull has soft spots called fontanelles. These flexible areas allow for growth as your brain develops and eventually harden into solid bone as you age!</p>

                    <p>Darwin didn’t actually coin the term “survival of the fittest”—that phrase was popularized by philosopher Herbert Spencer. Darwin did, however, use it in later editions of The Origin of Species, but he originally referred to the concept as "natural selection."</p>

                    <p>Explore the fascinating journey of transformation as you witness the incredible evolution of the butterfly. From the humble caterpillar to the delicate chrysalis, and finally, the vibrant adult butterfly. This exhibition showcases the wonder of metamorphosis in all its stages.</p>

            <h2>Adaptation and survival through evolution</h2>
            <p>Animals are a diverse group of living organisms that range from simple creatures like sponges to complex beings like humans. They play essential roles in ecosystems, serving as predators, prey, pollinators, and decomposers. </p>
            <p>Over millions of years, animals have evolved a wide range of adaptations to survive in various environments, from the depths of the oceans to the highest mountains. Whether through specialized features like the cheetah's speed or the bat's echolocation, animals demonstrate the remarkable ways in which evolution shapes life on Earth. Each species has its own unique traits, behaviors, and survival strategies, contributing to the intricate web of life.</p>

                    <p>Iguanas are a perfect example of evolution in action! The marine iguana of the Galápagos Islands has adapted to its unique environment by evolving the ability to swim and dive underwater to feed on algae, a rare trait among reptiles. Over time, these iguanas developed powerful claws and flattened tails to help them navigate in the water, showcasing how species can evolve to thrive in new or changing environments.</p>

                    <p>Step into the world of growth and change, where you can witness plants evolving in real-time. This exhibition highlights the incredible journey of plant development, from seedling to full bloom, showcasing nature’s ongoing process of adaptation and transformation</p>

                    <img src="../images/chimpanzee.jpg" alt="A baby chimpanzee lying in a hammock made of rope">
                    <p>Chimpanzees share about 98% of their DNA with humans, highlighting our close evolutionary relationship. Despite differences, both species share traits like problem-solving, social structures, and communication.</p>

                    <p>Crocodiles have remained largely unchanged for over 200 million years! They’re often called "living fossils" because their basic design has been so successful that they’ve survived multiple mass extinctions. Despite the changing world around them, their powerful jaws and ability to adapt to various environments have kept them thriving, proving the ultimate "survival of the fittest" in action!</p>
